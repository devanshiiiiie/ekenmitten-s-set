<h1> hi baby look this is an html page teeheehee </h1>
<p> i wanted to get some things out  
youre really stronk and brave for facing it on your own; you may think that the world will close down on you but i assure you, even if everyone turns their backs - ill still wait and hope that you make it out safe and sound. (i hate making things about me so ill be extra brief and get to the point quick before i start rambling again) ((whoops i just did that didnt i)) (((im sorry))) 
you dont have to read this, or do anything i or anyone else tells you; you can do things on your own terms. i believe in you and trust in you more than anyone else. youre the only one. 
and theres no way you'll be lesser than what you think you want to be, because i know you can do anything. i probably dont even grasp what youre feeling, neither the resentment, nor the pain; but the black and white days got nothing on you. 
everything you do - crying, doing math, playing roblox, postal, spamming gifs, stupid memes - all of it is valid and youre awesome. these words may sound hollow (or maybe im the only one who values words a lot) but i love you so ill do anything it takes for you to feel better and get out of this, no matter how long it takes 
im no writer so this is as far as my skills can take me. 
bye honey i love you so so so so so much </p>
